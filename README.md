# Clean-and-analyze-social-media-usage-data-with-Python

## Overview
This project involves analyzing social media data to enhance client reach and engagement through data-driven insights. Using Python and libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn, we conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand user behavior and engagement patterns.

## Project Objectives
- Increase client reach and engagement on social media platforms.
- Gain valuable insights through data analysis to improve social media performance.
- Provide data-driven recommendations to achieve social media goals effectively.

## Key Insights
- Identified high-performing content categories such as Travel_Vlog and Food_Vlog.
- Highlighted peak engagement months (March, November) and days (16th, 22nd, 23rd).
- Recommendations include focusing content efforts on top categories and strategic scheduling during peak periods.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection and Cleaning:**
   Ensured data integrity by cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   Utilized Python and libraries to visualize likes distribution, analyze category trends, and explore seasonal variations in engagement.
   
3. **Insights and Recommendations:**
   Derived actionable insights to optimize content strategies, enhance engagement metrics, and achieve project objectives.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effective use of data analytics to inform strategic decisions and improve social media performance. By implementing the recommended strategies, clients can expect to see measurable improvements in engagement and reach on their social media platforms.
